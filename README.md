You just need to download the two files on this repository:
- [abap_spec.xml](abap_spec.xml)
- [abap_user.xml](abap_user.xml)

Once you have these files on your computer, press Windows+R on your computer to open the "Run" app and copy paste the directory below:

%APPDATA%\SAP\SAP GUI\ABAP Editor

Paste the files you've downloaded inside this directory. Windows will ask if you want to replace the files, you can click on "Yes" to proceed.

#hint: You can backup this files so you can easily go back to the old and original look and feel of ABAP Editor in case you don't like the Dark version.

And that's it. You'll have to close and reopen SAP GUI to see the result.
