You know that the colors of the posts are from ABAP Editor, right? Take a look at some snippets in the next images and learn how to set this as your ABAP Editor theme.

Do you like the ABAP Editor colors of all posts you've seen here? I've created a Github page demonstrating and explaining on how to set this up

You can see the colors here:

You just need to download the two files on this repository:
- [abap_spec.xml](abap_spec.xml)
- [abap_user.xml](abap_user.xml)

Once you have these files on your computer, press Windows+R on your computer to open the "Run" app and copy paste the directory below:

%APPDATA%\SAP\SAP GUI\ABAP Editor

Paste the files you've downloaded inside this directory. Windows will ask if you want to replace the files, you can click on "Yes" to proceed.

#hint: You can backup this files so you can easile go back to the old and original look and feel of ABAP Editor in case you dont like the Dark version.

And that's it. You'll have to close and reopen SAP GUI to see the result.
